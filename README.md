# Motivation
Have you ever been overwhelmed by encountering 'katakana-translated terms', e.g., 'オブジェク', 'プロパティ', one after another. Or, Have you ever searched repeatedly from Japanese to English to understand the terms or concepts due to katakana-translated term and lack of explaination of the 'katakana-translated term', and did it led you to consume a lot of time?

In fact, I had experirenced many times in MDN(ja) or other websites. This made it difficult for me to understand the sentence or topics, and, in additon, this also made me feel pain. So, I've been learning programming in English as of those event. 

Almost all tutorials in Japanese webiste uses 'katakana-translated term' with no explanation of those terms, and this makes it difficult for the learner, especially beginner, to understand the sentence or the topics. Also, This makes the learner consume more and more time due to repetitive searching to understand the meaning of 'katakana-translated terms'. As a consequences, the learner lose motivation to continue to learn programming.

You may already experience those event.

The reason that those event occured is essentially the heavy use of katakana translation and lack of explanations of the 'katakana-translated terms'.

Anybody else don't undersand sentences that heavily contain katakana translation and lack explanations of the 'katakana-translated terms'.

For instance, if you'd ever learned English at high school, you may noticed the importance of knowledge of the meaning of all terms to understand the sentences. If you find two or three unknown terms in paragraph and, in addition, if those unknown terms plays a important role to grasp the whole sentence, you proverbly won't understand the sentence. This will also occur in your mother language, i.e. Japanese.

I assume that many programming learners feel difficult to learn programming as a result of heavy use of katakana translation. But, basically, Neither learning programming is  difficult things, nor the concepts in programming are difficult. It's very simple, logical and enjoyable! This is my honest feelings as I've been learning programming in four years.

This is not anybody else's faultness. For creators of tutorials, those are kind enough to spare times making tutorials for learners that follows without fees. However, such deficiency definitely creates unreasonable wall for learners. 

I absolutely love coding and learning programming! So, I want to take the wall away and prevent beginners or learners from leaving programming world. Programming is compelling and enjoyable! XD





# The reason why we should standardize en-ja translation of terms
I revealed below the steps of each mother language people to understand the term in each situation; English native people, Japanese people in katakana-translation and in proper translation.

***English native people***

```js
term(English)               [got it!]   // 1 step
```



***Japanese people*** in ***katakana-translation***
```js
katakana-translated-term(Japanes)
  ---> defintion(English)   [got it!]   // 2 steps
```


***Japanese people*** in ***proper translation***
```js
term(Japanes)               [got it!]   // 1 step

//
```


According to above comparison, both steps number of proper translation for Japanese people and English native people are the same.



# Solution
I suggest standardizing translation of terms for programming, that is, listing the terms that are fundamental in any programming language, and terms listed is tranlsated from English to Japanese in parallel. The translated Japanese term may be only one or more, and if the translated Japanese are two or more, those could be picked by the user, creator of the tutorial or translator of the documentation, according to its context.


If the concept essentially doesn't exist in Japanese, or the katakana-translated term is usually accepted as 'WASEI EIGO' in Japan, I've tranlsated those terms to 'katakana-translated term'.

## Merit
1. It enables learners to guess the meaning of the term from the 'kanji' and to understand the term like a native
2. (1) enables learners to proceed learning even if the tutorial lacks explanation of the term



## Exmaple
Suppose beginners read the following sentence...

### ×
```js
JavaScriptの値の種類は、オブジェクト、配列、文字、真偽値...
      //--> オブジェクトって何だ?? 学習が止まる
```

### ◯
```js
JavaScriptの値の種類は、物体、配列、文字、真偽値...
      //-> 各文字の意味は理解できる。全体はまだ良く分からずとも、そのまま次に進める
```



# Pull Requests, Suggestions
Welcome to any pull requests or suggestions! I convince that this makes those who learn programming in Japanese feel interesting and exciting to learn programming, too!
